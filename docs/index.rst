Python3 Implementation of Merkatilo
===================================

After having creating a considerable amount of very fast, complete, and huge
technical analysis tools in Java, C++ and Zentech, I just wanted something simple.
Thus, the merkatilo
libraries are
my most-used subset of functionality in single language implementations.  
This is the Python3 implementation.
